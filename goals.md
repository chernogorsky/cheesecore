Initial Goals

Make a RailCore2-like printer that:-
1. can be easier to source within the EU, with quality parts. Can either be a RailCore2 spec for parts or
 * 2020 extrusion and t-nuts and corners (1515 is hard to source)
 * 15mm rails 
 * 10mm leadscrews

2. Stays within the RailCore ecosystem in regards to.
 * Y carriage (12mm rail on the Y)
 * Bed (make any redesign RC2 compatible)
 * Keeping 8mm leadscrews and 12mm rails also can help.
In order to take advantage of existing parts.

3. Make enclosed from the beginning. i.e. a proper door and top enclosure.

4. The ability to modify, improve and eventually diverge where appropriate. 
However I'm also keen not to "add to core" just for the sake of it, and changes should be considered and tested.

5. Adding a RPi as standard, for additional functionality. 
 * Bossa for emergency flashing
 * USB and Octoprint (extra features and the ability to communicate with the Duet with a network issue)
 * Extra hardware that a Duet can't support.
 * Automated backups and a simple restore.
