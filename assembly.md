## RailcoreII 300ZL/ZLT Assembly Guide


##  \
Note: If building a kit from filastruder, use this updated guide: [https://railcore.page.link/fskit](https://railcore.page.link/fskit)


## Introduction

RailcoreII is a Core-XY based Reprap 3D printer designed by J. Steve White & Tony Akens and is published under the [CC-Attribution Only](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/) license.  The initial idea to collaborate on a printer started in the #reprap IRC channel, and centered on some common goals for a new printer design.

These were:-



*   Core-XY motion.
*   All Linear rails for movement
*   Space & cost Efficient, enclosable frame
*   Key components being printable, or able to be milled
*   Flexibility and scalability in the design
*   A professional looking printer
*   Self sourced and easily customizable.

J. Steve White had previously built the Railcore - the alpha version of this printer.  Lessons were learned and the design on the new printer began.  All design work was done in Fusion360.

As it progressed, we decided to publish this printer in an open, documented format for others to build as well.

The frame is designed to be 1515 aluminum extrusion.  This was a space efficient choice, which makes building the printer easier, as standard M3 hardware works like a T-Nut fitting into the extrusion nicely.  To add rigidity, we use HDPE sides to stiffen the frame.  (These can be cut out of any material you prefer, including melamine, plywood, acrylic & aluminum).  The total cost for the actual frame components (extrusion, corner cubes, and sides) is roughly $100.

Some notable aspects of the design: 3 trapezoidal lead screws Z-axis, stacked idlers and duo-planar belt path.  

The electronics in the design are the Duet (Wifi or Ethernet), Duex2/5,  24v PSU and 0.9 degree steppers.  We used an E3D v6 for the design, as it’s the most common hotend at this time.  Support for other hotends such as Bondtech and Mosquito and many others are also available. \
Semi-Direct drive or full bowden is supported.

## Recommended tools, notes to the build

To build this printer, there are some recommended tools you’ll want.  All of these are detailed in the “Tools” tab of the BOM.  You’ll need a 3mm tap to tap the ends of the extrusions.  A quality tap from Irwin is recommended, and makes it go much faster.  A 5.5mm Nut Driver is highly recommended (example: [https://www.amazon.com/MakerBeam-hex-nut-driver-pack/dp/B00G2DNXV2](https://www.amazon.com/MakerBeam-hex-nut-driver-pack/dp/B00G2DNXV2)), since most of the hardware is M3.  **It’s recommended you run a 3mm or 5mm drill bit through the holes in the printed parts to make threading bolts through them easier.  **

We chose to build with fairly premium components where it made sense.  This includes the Duet Wifi controller, PanelDue display, E3D v6 Hotend, 0.9 degree steppers, and 24v PSU, among other choices.  Many of these items can be subbed out for cheaper components to save cost.  Other components, such as the Linear Rails, can be improved in quality by being purchased from Misumi or Hiwin.  The design is made to be customizable based on your budget and goals.

It’s also very important that the frame extrusion cuts be **square** and **accurate**. We opted to have our extrusion pre-cut by Misumi; if you cut it yourself, be very, very obsessive about cutting them the proper length and having perfectly square end cuts. 


### Printed Parts

The printed parts list is available on Thingiverse, and detailed in the BOM on a separate tab.  For all structural parts, we recommend Atomic Filament’s Carbon Fiber PETG, or ABS be used.  4 perimeters, 4 bottom and 4 top layers work well for adding a lot of structural integrity to the parts.  

There are a few printed parts that can vary based on your hardware. 


### Before You Build

**	**There are some preparation steps that must happen before you start your build.



1. Tap the Extrusion Ends

        IF YOU BUY A KIT FROM FILASTRUDER, YOUR EXTRUSIONS COME PRE-TAPPED.


        SKIP THIS STEP AND HAVE A BEER INSTEAD.


        Using your 3mm x 0.5mm thread pitch tap, tap the extrusion ends to a depth of at least 10mm.  This is required for attaching the corner cubes to the extrusions.  Take your time to get good threads cut, running the tap in slowly and backing it out to clear the cut aluminum. It will go more smoothly if you use a bit of cutting oil or light machine oil on the tap.  The only ones that do not have to be tapped are the 445mm extrusions for the Z axis.  After tapping your extrusion ends it’s a good idea to deburr them with a countersink.

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II1.png "image_tooltip")


2. <Recommended> Check your rails for any missing ball bearings, and replace them.  

        If you ordered genuine rails or got a kit from Project R3d, this is not likely to be an issue.  If you ordered from Ebay or similar, it’s common for there to be some stiction from poor lubrication, missing ball bearings, etc.  We recommend buying some 3/32” diameter G25 ball bearings to replace any that are missing.  For lubrication, a PTFE based oil or light grease is recommended on the rails. Alternately, you can use light lithium grease, but the loading applied to these rails is very low and the lighter PTFE impregnated machine oils move with a little less effort. 

3. Sink the brass inserts into the printed parts

        You need to use a soldering iron to carefully sink the brass inserts into the printed parts.  Sink the inserts in ⅔ of the way, then press the carriage against a flat surface to get them flush.  After placing each insert you may need to clear the channel by running your tap down through the insert and into the plastic (be careful not to cross thread your inserts!)


        Here’s a good article about using the inserts: [https://hackaday.com/2019/02/28/threading-3d-printed-parts-how-to-use-heat-set-inserts/](https://hackaday.com/2019/02/28/threading-3d-printed-parts-how-to-use-heat-set-inserts/)


        The Y Carriage gets 18 x 3mm brass inserts.

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II3.png "image_tooltip")



        The X carriages get 1 x 5mm brass insert and 1 x 3mm brass inserts each.  (If you have a kit, the X carriages are aluminum, and you can skip these) Both are inserted into the bottom of the Carriage.  Be as precise as possible with the 5mm insert, as you want your idler bolt as straight up and down as possible.

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II4.png "image_tooltip")



        Each Electronics Box Corner gets one brass insert.  One end is thicker, to make putting the insert in easier.


        If you plan to use the TPU pads on the bottom of the feet, which help reduce noise, you can add two 3mm brass inserts to the bottom of each foot. **(TPU foot pads and brass inserts for the feet are not included with the kit, and are optional - if you put the brass inserts into the feet in the kit, you’ll run short)**

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II5.png "image_tooltip")



    4.  Lubricate Your Linear Rails


        Whether you got the kit or self-sourced, you should *carefully* remove your carriages, and lubricate the bearings in them.  You can use a light grease such as superlube 21030 or an oil, such as superlube 51010.  Taking the carriage off can be easier by moving it to a small printed bit of MGN12 rail such as [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1708320](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1708320)


        



### Frame Assembly



1. Top Extrusions Assembly

**	**Part List for this step:


    (2) 460mm extrusion (front, back)


    (2) 425 extrusion (left, right)


    (53) 3mm nut


    (20) M3 x 10mm hex head bolts


    (9) M3 x 16mm hex head bolts


    (8) M3 x 8mm button head bolts


    (8) M3 x 8mm button head bolts (or 6mm, check your linear rail depth for fit)


    (2) 400mm linear rail + carriage


    (4) Corner Cubes


    


    Lay out your extrusion as shown in this picture. 


    

<p id="gdcalert7" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/RailCore-II6.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert8">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/RailCore-II6.png "image_tooltip")



    The 460mm extrusions go in the front and back, and the 425mm extrusion goes on each side.  Place a corner cube at each corner.  Be sure to note the orientation of the corner cube.  A small hole needs to face the end of each rail, and a small hole needs to point down. It can be helpful to use a pencil or marker to write a small mark to note what each is on the top of the Extrusion.  I made a small letter on the top of each (F, R, B, L).  Masking tape is another way to mark them.


    Start with the 425mm Left Extrusion.  Attach back left corner cube to left extrusion using an 8mm button head bolt.  Just make sure the corner cube is snug for now.


    

<p id="gdcalert8" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/RailCore-II7.png).

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II7.png "image_tooltip")



    Holding the left extrusion as it will be oriented on the printer, slide the following parts into the extrusion.  (if you marked it, I recommend keeping your markings on the top of each extrusion, so it’s consistent)


    (8) M3 nut into the top channel (this includes 4 spares for any optional components you may add later)


    (5) M3 x 10mm Hex bolts in the outside channel 


    (4) M3 nut in the inside channel


    (6) M3 x 16mm hex head bolts in the bottom channel. 


    

<p id="gdcalert9" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/RailCore-II8.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert10">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/RailCore-II8.png "image_tooltip")



    Attach front left corner cube to left extrusion using (1) 3mm x 8mm button head bolt.


    

<p id="gdcalert10" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/RailCore-II9.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert11">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/RailCore-II9.png "image_tooltip")



    Attach front & rear extrusions (460mm) to left extrusion using (2) 3mm x 8mm button head bolts.


    

<p id="gdcalert11" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/RailCore-II10.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert12">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/RailCore-II10.png "image_tooltip")



    You should now have a C shaped part made of 3 extrusions, and two corner cubes.


    Now we’re going to slide some hardware into the front extrusion.


    (8) M3 nuts go in the top of the front extrusion. (All spare, 2 for optional panel due case)


    (5) M3 x 10mm hex head bolts go in the outside (facing you) of the front extrusion. These will hold the front panel on later.


    Now the same for the back extrusion.


    (8) M3 nuts go in the top channel (6 spare)


    (5) M3 x 10mm hex head bolts go in the outside channel (facing away from you) of the back extrusion. These will hold the back panel on later.


    

<p id="gdcalert12" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/RailCore-II11.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert13">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/RailCore-II11.png "image_tooltip")



    Now we’re going to attach the linear rails to the front and back extrusions.


    Take one of your 400mm linear rails and move the carriage to the center. Use a couple bits of easy to remove tape like masking tape or painters tape, and tape the carriage there so it doesn’t slide freely (you don’t want it falling off!)  My rails came with zip ties to keep the carriages from coming off, just clip those off now.  If your rails have little metal retainers, they can stay on - just move them to the ends of the rail.


    Now, select 4 evenly spaced holes on your rails (the two on the end, and two in the middle), and place in an 8mm button head bolt (if your rails are thinner, you may need to use a 6mm bolt - you can test fit one to know which you need before you do them all).  


    Now loosely thread a nut onto the bolt, leave a gap between the back of the rail and the nut.


    

<p id="gdcalert13" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/RailCore-II12.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert14">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/RailCore-II12.png "image_tooltip")



    Now carefully line up the rail, and slide it onto the inside face of the back extrusion.  Once it’s fully on, use an allen wrench to snug up the bolts.  They don’t have to be tight just yet.  The position of the linear rails is finalized later in the guide. The rail should start 25 mm from the right hand end of each extrusion (which will leave a 35 mm gap on the left hand end).


    Now repeat the above steps with another 400mm linear rail, and attach it to the inside face of the front extrusion.   Remember, it only needs to be snug, don’t crank it down.

	(2) 425mm (left, right)

	(4) corner cube

	(8) M3 x 8mm Button Head Bolts

	(32) M3 x 10mm Hex Head Bolts

	(17) M3 x 16mm Hex Head Bolts

	(8) M3 nuts


    Lay out the parts like you did for the top extrusion assembly.  Corner cubes on each corner, this time with a small hole pointing up.  Put a 460mm extrusion for the front and back, and two 425mm extrusions for the sides.

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II27.png "image_tooltip")



    You’ve now completed the assembly of the bottom extrusions.  Be sure to keep track of which is the front channel, it may help to mark it with a piece of tape if you haven’t already.. 


    At this point it can be helpful to prop the bottom up using the feet as stands, to keep the bolts from digging into your table or work surface.  (Empty Filament spools work well, too)



3. Upright Extrusions Assembly

	Parts needed in this step:

	Bottom Frame Assembly (from Step 2)

	(4) 415mm Extrusions

	(4)  M3 x 8mm button head bolts

	(40) M3 x 10mm hex head bolts

	(32) M3 nuts (optional - the kit does include enough)

	


    Bolt all four of the upright 415mm extrusions to your bottom assembly using (4) M3 x 8mm button head bolts. (One for each corner cube)


    

<p id="gdcalert29" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/RailCore-II28.png).

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II28.png "image_tooltip")



    Now we’re just going to drop some hardware down each of the channels.  Again, be sure to keep track of which extrusion is which.


    **If you are building a 300ZLT, put 7 bolts in the outside channels of the upright extrusions instead of 5 for the 300ZL in the steps below.**

	In the front channel of the front left extrusion place (5) M3 x 10mm hex head bolts.

	In the left channel of the front left extrusion place (5) M3 x 10mm hex head bolts.

	In the front channel of the front right extrusion place (5) M3 x 10mm hex head bolts.

	In the right channel of the front right extrusion place (5) M3 x 10mm hex head bolts.

	In the left channel of the rear left extrusion place (5) M3 x 10mm hex head bolts.

	In the rear channel of the rear left extrusion place (5) M3 x 10mm hex head bolts.

	In the right channel of the rear right extrusion place (5) M3 x 10mm hex head bolts.

	In the rear channel of the rear right extrusion place (5) M3 x 10mm hex head bolts.

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II29.png "image_tooltip")



    **(Optional)** If you want to be able to add things later such as camera mounts, etc, now’s a good time to add M3 nuts.  I added (4) M3 nuts to both of the inside channels for each upright extrusion.  (32) M3 nuts total.  These are not used in the build directly, but are much easier to add now than after the build is complete.  (You can actually add M3 nuts to any inside facing channel you wish, if you think they may be useful later.  The outside channels will be covered by your side panels, so M3 nuts in them won’t be usable)



4. Attach top assembly to uprights

    Parts used in this step:


    (4) M3 x 8mm Button Head Bolts


    Top Assembly from step 1


	


    Take your completed top extrusion assembly, paying attention to which is the front extrusion, and put it on top of the uprights. Bolt it down with (4) M3 x 8mm button head bolts.  Your frame is now complete!   Up until now, we’ve been just snugging up the bolts in the corner cubes.  Now is the time to tighten them all up.  I suggest doing a review of the count for the nuts and bolts in each extrusion now, as it’s hard to correct them later.  You can optionally remove each corner cube bolt one at a time, and use a drop of blue loctite on them.  **(If you want to use loctite on the corner cubes, now would be the time)**

### 


### Z-Bracket installation

	

**	**



1. Attach the Z Brackets

	

	Parts needed for this step:

	(3) Z_Bracket_Top

	(3) Z_Bracket_Bottom

	(54) M3 Nuts

	(12) M3 x 8mm Button Head Bolts

	(24) M3 x 16mm Hex Head Bolts

**_	Be sure not to get the “Z_Bracket_Top” and “Z_Bracket_Bottom” parts mixed up!_**


    Starting on the left side, bolt on the following.  Be careful to compare to the picture so you get the order correct.


    Starting from the front, on the top left extrusion, bolt on a Z_Bracket_Bottom (with the “arm” facing the back of the printer) Z_Bracket_Top (with the “arm” facing the front of the picture).  Each of these should attach to the bolts in the extrusion using (3) 3mm nuts.  Leave them loose enough you can move them.


    On the bottom left extrusion, starting from the front, attach a Z_Bracket_Top (with the “arm” pointing to the back) and a Z_Bracket_Bottom (with the arm pointing to the front).

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II31.png "image_tooltip")



    Next, attach the Linear rails for the Z axis to the extrusion. It’s easier to bolt the linear rail to your extrusion before attaching it.  Take one of the 400mm linear rails, and place (4) M3 x 8mm button head bolts in it.  (If building the ZLT, use (8) per rail, evenly spaced)  Loosely place (4) M3 nuts on, one per bolt, evenly spaced along the rail.

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II32.png "image_tooltip")



    (Number of holes between bolts can vary from this picture, evenly space them, with one at each end)


    Now you can slide those M3 nuts into the channel one of the 445mm extrusions, and use an allen wrench to tighten it down.  Don’t make it too tight yet - we’ll adjust it later.  Use some masking tape to keep the carriage from falling off.

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II34.png "image_tooltip")



    You then slide these M3 bolts through the rear two Z brackets you installed (it fits between the Z bracket and the bearing block), and attach them with (8) M3 nuts.

    Repeat the above process for the right side.  Begin by attaching Z_Bracket_Top to the top right extrusion using (3) M3 nuts.  Note when attaching to the right side, this will mean the “arm” of the Z_Bracket_Top points towards the back of the printer, and you should use the 3 bolts closest to the back of the printer.  Attach Z_Bracket_Bottom to the bottom right extrusion using (3) M3 nuts, again using the bolts closest to the back of the printer.  The arm for this bracket should also point to the back of the printer.

### 


### Sides installation

**	**Parts Needed for this section:

	(4) Foot

	(100) M3 Nuts or M3 Nylon Lock Nuts


    **FOR THE HDPE SIDE PANELS, THE TEXTURED SIDE FACES OUT OF THE PRINTER FOR ALL THE PANELS EXCEPT THE BOTTOM.  ON THE BOTTOM PANEL THE TEXTURED SIDE FACES UP TOWARDS THE PRINT AREA.**


    Before doing this step you can attach the small TPU foot pads onto the feet.  To do this you need to sink M3 threaded inserts into the holes on the bottom of the feet.  Then use (2) M3 x 8mm bolts to attach the inserts.  This is entirely optional, and can be done later if you decide you want to add them.


    


    Turn your printer frame upside down, so the bottom is facing up.   Place the bottom Bottom panel over the protruding bolts (the textured side of the HDPE for the bottom panel should face IN towards the body of the printer), the two small holes should be nearest the front and back of your printer.  **It’s very important that the two stepper holes be on the left side of your frame! (the same side that you put two rails on)** It can be tricky to line the bolts up with each hole, and may work better with someone assisting. Use needle nose pliers to straighten the bolts.  Place the feet over the two bolts at each corner.  You should be able to thread a nut onto each bolt.  You can use either 20 Nylon Lock nuts, or 20 standard M3 nuts, it’s really just a matter of aesthetic preference, as they don’t come loose. **(For the kit, use nylock nuts, or you’ll run out of regular m3 nuts - this goes for all of the panels)**  Tighten them all down using your nut driver, making sure the panel is centered.

    Next Turn your panel so the “back” is down, and place the front panel on.  This is the one with the large cut out.  It also has extra bolts, to make up for the lower surface area.  Place it over the bolts, and once it’s centered, place 20 nylon lock nuts, or 20 M3 nuts on, and tighten them down.

    Now lay the printer with the right side down, and bolt on the left side the same way using either 20 M3 Nylon lock nuts, or 20 M3 nuts.  The textured side should face out.


    

<p id="gdcalert46" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/RailCore-II45.png).

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II45.png "image_tooltip")



    


    Now rotate the printer so the left side (the one you just put on) is facing down, and install the right panel using 20 M3 nylon lock nuts, or 20 M3 nuts.  


    On this panel,the orientation of the holes is very important.  The holes for mounting the duet and duex5, as well as the larger hole for your wiring bundle (it’s a good idea to deburr this hole so it’s not scraping your wires), should be near closer to the front of your printer, with the hole for the wiring at the top.  The two small holes in the corners should be to the top, and the textured side should face out.


    

<p id="gdcalert47" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/RailCore-II46.png).

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II46.png "image_tooltip")



    The last one is the back panel. Place the printer with the front side facing down, and install the back panel the same as the others using 20 nylon lock nuts, or 20 M3 nuts.


    

<p id="gdcalert48" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/RailCore-II47.png).

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II47.png "image_tooltip")



    Your sides should all now be firmly attached and frame is complete.  Before moving on, make sure that all of the side panels are flush with the top rail - if any protrude above or below, loosen up the nuts slightly and adjust the panel.  This is especially critical for the left & right panels, having them too high or too low can affect the idler and stepper mounts.


### Square your frame


    Now is the best time to stop and square your frame.  Measure the corner to corner diagonals, or use a good metal square.  Make sure all of the sides are square.  If you find any that aren’t, loosen the panel(s) that correspond to that dimension, pull the frame into square, then tighten the nuts on the panel again.  Squaring your frame here will save you a ton of headache vs. doing it later.

	

	

	


### Y Linear Rail Installation

	(1) 400mm linear rail

	(1) Back_X_Carriage

	(1) Front_X_Carriage

	(2) M5 x 50mm cap head bolts

	(6) M5 washers

	(2) M5 nylon lock nuts

	(2) GT2 5mm bore smooth idler

	(2) GT2 20T x 5mm bore toothed idlers

	(8) M3 x 8mm button head bolts (possibly M3 x 6mm button head, test fit)

	(2) M3 x 10mm button head bolts

	(2) M3 x 16mm button head bolts

	(2) M3 nuts


    5mm ID 6mm OD Shims \
	 \
If using the aluminum X carriages you need two 20mm shoulder bolts instead of the (2) M5 bolts & nuts


    Before putting on the Y rails, we need to put the idlers & pulleys on the X Carriages.  **(NOTE: I recommend two shims between the idlers, one below, and one above)** The important part is to get the idlers and pulleys in the correct order.  For the back X carriage the smooth idler goes on top.  Start with an M5 x 50mm Cap Head Bolt.  Place the smooth idler on, then an M5 washer, then the 20T pulley, then another washer.  Pass it through the back X carriage, and then put on an M5 washer and M5 nylon Lock nut.  It should all be snug, but both the idler and pulley should be able to turn freely.  The X carriage insert is illustrated here to show where it goes, hang on to it for now.  Insert one M3 x 10mm button head bolt into the bottom of the carriage, just far enough it’s fully threaded into the insert.


    


    **If you’re using printed X carriages, yours will look like this.**  If you have the shims replace the washers with them.

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II48.png "image_tooltip")



    


    **If you’re using the aluminum parts, your rear X carriage will look like this**


    You need to adjust the number of shims above the top idler to eliminate any play in the stack.  If you only have a single bag of shims, use one M5 washer at the top of the stack, then 3 shims.

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II49.png "image_tooltip")



    


    Repeat this process for the front X carriage but on the front one be sure the pulley is on top, and the smooth idler is on the bottom.


    **If you’re using the printed X carriage, it will look like this.**

    **If you’re using the aluminum parts, your front X carriage will look like this (the engravingengaving faces in towards the center of the printer)**


    You need to adjust the number of shims above the top idler to eliminate any play in the stack.  If you only have a single bag of shims, use one M5 washer at the top of the stack, and 3 shims.

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II52.png "image_tooltip")


Now take your 400mm MGN 12 Y rail, and place the Back X Carriage and Front X Carriage over the ends of the rail.  The bolt holes should face out, for attaching to the X carriages, and the X carriages should point out in the same direction as the carriage on the Y rail as in the picture below.  Place an M3 Nut into the small slot in each of the carriers, and place an M3 x 16mm button head bolt in the side of each carrier.  Do not tighten these down yet.


    

<p id="gdcalert54" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/RailCore-II53.png).

    Remove any tape you have holding down the MGN12 X carriages, then attach the X carriages to the two MGN12 X carriages using (4) M3 x 8mm Button head bolts each.  The idlers should be towards the right side of your printer.  Tape these back down so your Y axis doesn’t slide off the rails!

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II54.png "image_tooltip")



    You may wish to tape the Y carriage in place so it doesn’t rattle around.

	


### Steppers 

	Parts needed in this step:

	(2) X/Y Nema17 Stepper motors (0.9 Degree E3D Steppers if building the Kit)

	Front_Motor_Mount

	Rear_Motor_Mount

	(20) M3 x 10mm Button Head Bolts

	(14) M3 washers

(2) 16t pulleys

	

**SCROLL DOWN IF YOU HAVE THE ALUMINUM STEPPER MOUNTS**

	

	All of the steppers install on the upper right extrusion, when facing the front of the printer.


    Starting with the back motor mount (the cutout for clearancing a bolt should be towards the center of the printer), begin by attaching it to the right side of the printer frame using (2) M3 x 10mm button head bolts.  The bolts will go into two of the M3 nuts you dropped into the frame at the beginning.  Use the two M3 nuts closest to the back of the frame!  Then attach one of your steppers to it using (4) M3 x 10mm button head bolts.  Position the stepper all the way in towards the printer body in the slots.  Attach a 16T pulley to it.  Orient the Pulley so the grub screw collar is down, and the threads are on top.  Don’t crank the stepper or the pulley down tight yet, as they’ll be adjusted later.


    

<p id="gdcalert56" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/RailCore-II55.png).

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II55.png "image_tooltip")



    Attach the front motor mount the same as you did the rear, using (2) M3 x 10mm button head bolts to attach it to the extrusion, and then (4) M3 x 10mm button head bolts to attach the stepper.  Position the stepper all the way in towards the printer body in the slots.  Get the bolts snug, but don’t crank them down as you’ll need to adjust the spacing later.  Attach a 16 T pulley to the front stepper, this time with the grub collar towards the top and the teeth down.


    

<p id="gdcalert57" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/RailCore-II56.png).

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II56.png "image_tooltip")



    Note the front pulley has its teeth to the bottom and the rear pulley has its teeth to the top.  This is critical.




### 	Aluminum Stepper Mounts


    If you have the aluminum Stepper Mounts, they should look like this - attach to the frame using (4) M3 x 10mm Button head bolts, attach the steppers as indicated for the plastic mounts above, using (4) M3 x 8mm button head bolts per stepper.

### Idler Carriers

	Front_Stationary_Idler_Carrier

	Back_Stationary_Idler_Carrier

	(2) Idler_Spacer

	(4) M5 x 50mm cap head bolts

	(4) M5 lock nuts

	(4) GT2 20T x 5mm bore toothed idlers

	(8) M5 washers

	(4) M3 x 10mm button head bolts


    If using the aluminum Idler carriers you need (2) 20mm Shoulder bolts and (2) 10mm shoulder bolts instead of the M5 bolts & nuts


#### 	Back Stationary Idler Carrier


    Begin by assembling the back idler carrier.  The outside of the carrier has a longer tab that points down, with a screw hole.  On the back carrier, that’s the side that gets the Idler spacer.  **(NOTE: Replace the washers in these steps with shims.  Instead of the printed spacer you can use a spare idler as a spacer to make aligning easier)  **Take a 5mm cap head bolt, and place a GT2 20T idler on it, then an m5 washer, then your idler spacer.  Insert this bolt into the outside of the carrier, and lock it on with an m5 washer & lock nut.  You want it to be snug, but still allow the idler to spin freely.


    Take another m5 x 50mm cap head bolt, and put a GT2 20T idler on, followed by an m5 washer.  Put this through the 5mm hole on the inside of the carrier, and lock it on using an m5 washer and nylon lock nut.  Again, make it tight, but so that the idler still spins freely.

**If you’re using the aluminum idler carriers, they should look like this**


    **Be very careful when threading the shoulder bolts in - it can help to thread one in from the back to open it up some.  These are very easy to cross thread.**


    You need to adjust the number of shims below the idlers to eliminate any play in the stack.  You may need to use one washer in place of some of the shims so you have enough.  These are attached using (4) M3 x 8mm Button head bolts.

    Place the back idler carrier over the top of the left extrusion, in the back corner of the printer.  Be sure the tab is on the outside of the printer.  Use (2) M3 x 10mm bolts to attach it to the two M3 nuts closest to the back of the printer.  It should be against the back rail, we’ll adjust it more later, so it only needs to be snug for now.

#### 	Front Stationary Idler Carrier


    Now we’ll assemble the front idler carrier much the same way, but the idler is reversed.  The outside of the carrier has a longer tab that points down, with a screw hole.  On the front carrier, it gets only a GT2 20T idler.  Take a 5mm cap head bolt, and place a GT2 20T idler on it, then an m5 washer.  Insert this bolt into the outside of the carrier, and lock it on with an m5 washer & lock nut.  You want it to be snug, but still allow the idler to spin freely.


    Take another m5 x 50mm cap head bolt, and put a GT2 20T idler on, followed by an m5 washer, then an idler spacer.  Put this through the 5mm hole on the inside of the carrier, and lock it on using an m5 washer and nylon lock nut.  Again, make it tight, but so that the idler still spins freely.

### Y Carriage Installation

Parts needed in this step:

Y_Carriage

	E3DV6_Groove_Mount

	Titan_Mount / BMG Mount

	Y_Endstop_Mount

	IR_Probe_Mount or BLTouch Mount

	IR Probe or BLTouch

	(15) M3 x 8mm button head bolts

	(2) M3 Nuts

	(2) m2 x 12mm bolts (from the IR probe kit)

	(2) m2 nuts


    Taking your Y carriage, line it up with your Y linear rail carriage (remove any tape if you were holding it in place!) and attach it using (4) M3 x  8mm Button Head Bolts.

#### 
    Probe option: BLTouch


    It’s easiest to attach the BLTouch to the mount, before installing the BLTouch mount on the printer.  When installing it, use (2) M3 x 20mm button head bolts, pass them through the holes in the BLTouch, then put on (2) M3 brass inserts as spacers.  Then slide the bolts through the holes in the BLTouch mount, and put on the M3 nuts, as pictured.  (A short bit of belt between the bltouch and the mount makes a nice vibration damper) \

    Next, attach the BLTouch mount to the bottom left two holes on the Y carriage using (2) M3 x 8mm Button Head bolts.


    


#### 
    Probe option: IR Probe


    Attach the IR Probe mount to the lower two of the leftmost brass inserts) on the Y carriage using (2) M3 x 8mm Button head bolts. (You may find it easier to attach the IR probe before installing the mount)  


#### 
    Y endstop and BMG Mounts


    Attach the Y endstop mount to the bottom right two holes using (2) M3 x 8mm Button head bolts.


    Attach the titan/BMG mount to the 4 brass inserts on the Y carriage using (4) M3 x 8mm button head bolts.

    Attach the mini-IR probe to the IR Probe mount, attach it on the back side of the mount, with the wire headers pointed towards the rear of the printer.  Use the m2 nuts and bolts (12mm m2 bolts) (Some IR probes come with m2.5 nuts and bolts, those can also be used) It’s a good idea to trim the back of the pins on the IR probe so it fits better on the mount.  It can also be helpful to bend the pins to point up at a 90 degree angle (or desolder the pins, and solder on a right angle pin).  Doing this is recommended, but can gain you some Y distance.

### X/Y Belts

**	**Parts used in this step:

GT2 belt

(4) Belt_Retainer_Clip

	(4) M3 x 45mm cap head bolts

(4) M3 x 16mm button head

	(8) M3 washers

	(4) M3 nylon lock nuts

	


#### 	Front / Lower Belt


    Take one end of your GT2 belt (the 5m long spool of it) and clip it into one of the belt retainer clips Match the teeth of the belt up to the teeth in the clips, and loop it around the shorter side.  Leave about an inch extend past the edge of the clip.

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II73.png "image_tooltip")



    Using (1) 45mm cap head bolt, secure that into the Y carriage in the bottom hole facing the front of the printer.   The teeth on the belt should be pointing towards the left side of the printer body.  You should be able to tighten the clip down until it’s flush with the front of the Y carriage.

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II74.png "image_tooltip")



    Now we’re going to thread this belt through.  It comes straight out from the Y carriage, and around the smooth idler on the front X carriage.  The back of the belt should be against the idler.  It will bend at a 90 degree angle to the right around the idler, and go around the front stepper pulley.  The teeth should grip the pulley.  Come back across the front of the printer, and around the single stack toothed idler on the front idler carrier.  It then goes along the left side of the printer, and around the single stack toothed idler on the rear idler carrier.  It then passes along the back of the printer to the lower toothed idler on the back X carriage.  It will then return to the Y carriage, in the lower belt retainer spot on the rear of the Y carriage.  Attach another belt retainer clip, test the fit to make sure the belt is going to be tight. (Fine tuning of the belt tension will come later, so don’t worry about really cranking it down yet).  Use (1) M3 x 45mm cap head bolt to attach the belt retaining clip into the Y carriage.  Once you’re satisfied with the position of the clip, cut the excess belt, leaving about an inch extending out from the clip.

    Note for Aluminium Y carriage


    The original printed parts were 8mm thick, everything along the entire path was 2mm higher,The aluminum parts are not 8mm thick.everything is 2mm lower thus you gotta flip those clips the other way.

    	Front / Lower belt path


#### 
    Rear / Upper belt


    The rear stepper belt is installed much the same way.  Begin by looping the belt over one of the belt retainer clips, again, leave an inch or so of extra. Using (1) 45mm cap head bolt, secure that into the Y carriage in the top hole facing the front of the printer.   The teeth on the belt should be pointing towards the left side of the printer body.  You should be able to tighten the clip down until it’s flush with the front of the Y carriage.

    Now we’re going to thread this belt through.  It comes straight out from the Y carriage, and around the toothed idler on the front X carriage.  The teeth of the belt should be against the idler.  It will bend at a 90 degree angle to the left around the toothed idler, and go back across the front of the printer, and around the upper toothed idler on the front idler carrier.  It then goes along the left side of the printer, and around the upper outside toothed idler on the rear idler carrier.  It then passes along the back of the printer to the toothed pulley on the rear stepper.  The teeth should engage the pulley teeth.  The belt then goes back along the rear of the printer, and around the upper smooth idler on the rear X carriage.  The back of the belt should be against the idler.  It will then return to the Y carriage, in the upper belt retainer spot on the rear of the Y carriage.  Attach another belt retainer clip, test the fit to make sure the belt is going to be tight. (Fine tuning of the belt tension will come later, so don’t worry about really cranking it down yet).  Use (1) M3 x 45mm cap head bolt to attach the belt retaining clip into the Y carriage.

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II79.png "image_tooltip")



    	The rear stepper / upper belt path


#### 
    Aligning the Belts

	


    We now need to align the belts to get good precision out of your printer.  This step is very critical, so take your time.


    First, adjust the height of your stepper pulleys, so the belt paths are parallel to the frame.  To do  this, simply loosen up the pulley grub screws and move them up or down until the belts are parallel.  I used a bubble level to be sure my frame was level, then levelled the belts to match.


    Once both stepper pulleys are set, you need to adjust your steppers and idler carrier positioning to your belts are square.  The idea is that the belt turns at exactly a 90 degree angle when it goes around the X carriages.  You need to loosen up your M3 bolts holding your stepper and your idler carriers, and adjust them until the belts are at a 90 degree angle.  (For the idler carriers, the belt should be at a 90 degree angle when the carrier is flush against the outside rail)


    In the below drawing, the belts are highlighted to show the segments you’ll be adjusting until they’re at 90 degree angles.  The two green segments should be at 90 degrees, the two red at 90 degrees, etc.  In the end, the green and red at the back of the printer should be parallel to the frame.


    

<p id="gdcalert82" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/RailCore-II80.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert83">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/RailCore-II80.png "image_tooltip")



    Once the belts are aligned, you should snug up the M3 bolts on the stepper and idler carriers connecting them to the frame - you don’t want these to move now!  (I put a little loctite on mine, but it’s not required)


#### 
    Reinforce the motor mounts and idler carriers


    Once you’re satisfied in the position of the belts, and have the idler carriers and motor carriers locked in place, we need to secure them with a bolt to help prevent them flexing.  (**If you have the optional aluminum motor mounts & idler carriers from 713Maker, you can skip this step**).


    First, take off your belts by removing the (4) M3 x 45mm cap head screws from the Y carriage (You can remove two, and leave two in, or even just loosen them up enough to slip the belts off of the stepper pulleys - you just need the belts off so you can remove the steppers).  Then remove the X/Y steppers from their motor mounts by removing the (8) M3 x 8mm button head bolts.


    Starting with the idler carriers, use a 3mm drill bit, and drill straight in through the hole in the tab. Once you’ve drilled the holes, use (2) M3 x 16mm button head bolts, and on the inside use an M3 washer & nylon lock nut to lock them in place.

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II81.png "image_tooltip")



    Now we do the same with the X/Y stepper mounts.  Drill a hole in the melamine through the hole in the printed part.  Secure these with (2) M3 x 16mm button head bolts, (2) M3 washers, and (2) M3 nylon lock nuts.


    

<p id="gdcalert84" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/RailCore-II82.png).

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II82.png "image_tooltip")



    You can now reinstall the steppers, and then reinstall the X/Y belts.

    (Note: I’ve taped the wiring inside the bottom of the rear extrusion to hide it in this photo, just drape it over the back of the printer, below your belts, for now)


#### 
    Hotend and Extruder


    If you haven’t already, you need to assemble your E3D V6.  For that, follow E3D’s instructions here: [https://e3d-online.dozuki.com/Guide/V6+Assembly/6](https://e3d-online.dozuki.com/Guide/V6+Assembly/6)

	

	Your hotend should now look something like this:

	

<p id="gdcalert88" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/RailCore-II86.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert89">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/RailCore-II86.png "image_tooltip")


There might be a few differences - I like to tidy up my wiring using zip ties.  I’m using a collet clip from seemecnc to keep the retaining collet locked in place.  I also use (and highly recommend) Carpricorn’s low friction PTFE tubing.  You want a good bit of extra, we’ll trim it down soon.

The next part is a little tricky, you’ll need to assemble your E3D titan following the guide here for a bowden install: [https://e3d-online.dozuki.com/Guide/1.75mm+Bowden+Titan+Assembly/20](https://e3d-online.dozuki.com/Guide/1.75mm+Bowden+Titan+Assembly/20) \
 \
If you have the bondtech BMG, watch the video here (sub in the e3d bowden coupling not the hotend itself): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTUppEUFXVE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTUppEUFXVE)

When you get to Step 10 & 11 of the Titan guide, it talks about cutting the tubing.  (This also applies equally to the BMG)  This needs to be precise.  On the railcore there is a 25mm gap between the top of the v6 and the bottom of the titan.  You need to add that space to the 16mm they tell you to leave, for a total of 41mm extending out of the end of the v6.  (The total length of the PTFE should be 91mm)  Personally, I recommend cutting it even longer, and shortening it down as needed until it fits.  You can always remove some, it’s much harder to put it back together.

So, start with 45, or even 50mm.  Slide the bowden coupler on, then the 1.75mm titan filament guide tube onto the end of the PTFE, and test fit the v6 in the groovemount.  Cut a few mm off the PTFE at a time until it’s a snug fit with no play.  So as you slide the hotend into the groovemount on the Y carriage, you’re sliding the bowden coupler into the groove on the titan at the same time.

Once that’s done and fits snugly, proceed with the rest of the titan instructions.  When you are putting the bolts on the titan to close it, you’ll find you need (3) 3mm washers per each of the three bolts to tighten it down due to the spacing of the railcore’s titan mount. (Extra washers are not needed for the bondtech BMG)

Once your titan is assembled, lock in your E3D v6 using (2) 30mm Button head bolts to attach the E3DV6 Retaining Clip to the groovemount.

#### 	Cooling Fan


    Place the 50mm blower fan into the cooling shroud (it will friction fit) and then bolt the cooling shroud onto the bottom of the Y carriage using (2) M3 x 10mm Button Head Bolts.  I cut a short length of GT2 belt to put above the fan, between the top of the fan and the bottom of the Y carriage, to keep it pressed in more firmly.  You may need to add a couple of m3 washers between the fan shroud and Y carriage, to lower it until the shroud is pointing just at the tip of the v6 nozzle.  (I use two washers per bolt on mine).

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II89.png "image_tooltip")



#### 	X Endstop and Rail Adjustment


    You should now have all the components installed on your X/Y axis, it’s time to align your X rails.  Take off any masking tape you still have holding things in place.  Carefully move your Y rail towards the left side of the printer, keeping the Y carriage centered on it.  Watch that the carriages don’t go off the end of the X rails - if they’re close to doing so, stop, loosen up your X rail bolts, and adjust them to the left.


    Loosen the two bolts on your X endstop, and move it towards the right side of your printer, until there is a 25mm space between it and the inside face of your top left extrusion.  Tighten down the bolts for your X endstop.  Later, once your Z axis and bed is installed, you can adjust this so your hotend moves nicely and doesn’t hit your yokes, and X0 should be at the edge of your bed.


    Now, move your Y rail to the center.  Loosen up your two X linear rails, and slide them to the right until  the left ends of the MGN12 linear rails are also 25mm away from the left extrusion of your printer.  Place your two rail alignment tools one on each of of the rail to be sure it’s centered on the extrusion, and then tighten down all 4 bolts holding the rail to the extrusion.  Repeat for the other rail.


    As a final step, make sure your Y MGN12 linear rail is centered front to back on the printer between the X carriages, and tighten down the horizontal retaining screws you installed in them earlier.  Don’t worry about squaring it yet, we’ll do that later.

    Place the leadscrews into the Couplers, and attach the yokes to the linear rail carriages using (4) M3 x 10mm Button Head Bolts per yoke (if you have the aluminum Z yokes, they need to be 12mm).  The Front left gets the Z_yoke_1, the other two get Z_yoke_2.  (They’ll only match up to the carriages in one way.)

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II97.png "image_tooltip")



    To align the Z extrusions, move the yoke all the way to the bottom (don’t let the carriage run off the rail).  Tighten up the bottom of the extrusion.  Use a square to align the extrusion at a 90 degree angle to the side extrusions.  When you’re done, ensure you can still run the yoke up and down smoothly by hand.  (It can be difficult to fit a square behind the leadscrew.  Once the bottom is locked in place, you can optionally remove the leadscrew temporarily to help square the Z extrusions)


    There is a new alternative for aligning your Z towers, see the youtube guide here: [https://youtu.be/CNWzMLc5-Cg](https://youtu.be/CNWzMLc5-Cg)


### Bed installation

	Bed

	Thermistor

	RTV

	LokBuild

	(3) M3 x 20mm Button Head bolts (Optionally, 5/16 nylon bolts)

	(3) M3 Nylon Lock Nuts

	(3) M3 Washers

	(3) Nylon Washers

	(3) Nylon Spacers (or rubber washers)

	

	


#### 
    Preparation


    For the bed, we need to start with some prep.  


    There is a groove on the top of your bed - this is for the thermistor.


    Install your thermistor in the channel on the top of the bed.  If you bought the thermistors in the BOM, they have very long leads on them, and are protected in rubber all the way up to the bead.  Be careful with the thermistor, the bead is glass, and if it’s broken it won’t give a reading, or will be way off.  Place the thermistor into the channel in the top of the bed.  Use some RTV silicone to hold the bead in - I covered about ⅜” of the thermistor in RTV - just the end near the glass bead, and a bit near the side of the bed.  Use a razor blade to clean up the excess RTV and let it dry.  (Kapton tape can be used to cover it until it’s dry)


    I cut my lokbuild so it matched the size of the entire bed surface, and carefully placed it over the bed.  Be sure the thermistor is flush with the top surface, so you don’t get a bump in the lokbuild.  (If you used kapton to hold the RTV, remove it before installing the lokbuild)  Start from one corner and slowly apply it to the bed.  IF YOUR LOKBUILD DOESN’T COMPLETELY COVER THE BED SURFACE YOU MAY WISH TO WAIT AND PLACE IT ONCE YOU CAN VERIFY THE RANGE OF YOUR NOZZLE. Being flush to the left side of the bed is probably ideal.


    Next install your Keenovo on the bottom of the heated bed.  I tested the fit of mine with the backing on first, and marked with a pencil where it should go.  It should be centered front to back, and approximately 5mm away from the left edge.  The keenovo’s adhesive is EXTREMELY sticky, so once it’s placed you’re not moving it.  Be sure the leads exit the correct side of the bed.  They should go in the same direction as the thermistor channel on the top of the bed.


#### 	Bed


    Install the bed using the 20mm Bolts.  They fit through the top of the slot on the bed, with a M3 fender washer washer (in place of the nylon washer in the image below).  There should be a nylon spacer or rubber washer between the bed & yoke. **The current best recommendation are ¼ Flat faucet washers. You can get them at any hardware store**  Below the yoke install a M3 fender washer & Nylon lock nut.  These should be snug, firm enough the bed doesn’t move easily, but not so much that you’re crushing the washers..  It’s important the bed can shift and tilt slightly in the yokes, if not, the Z leveling will bind.

#### 
    THE RAILCORE IS A “DIY” PROJECT - BUILD SAFE, BUILD SMART, AND BE RESPONSIBLE.  WHEN IN DOUBT, DOUBLE CHECK THINGS. 3D PRINTERS CAN GET VERY HOT, USE COMMON SENSE AND QUALITY COMPONENTS. **BUILD AT YOUR OWN RISK!** 


#### 	Electronics Enclosure


    Bolt each of the 4 standoffs into the holes on the right side of the printer (Below the steppers) using  (4) M3 x 16mm button head bolts, (8) M3 Washers and (4) M3 nuts.  The brass inserts should face out away from the side panel. Note these go in the top & bottom most set of holes. There is a center set that is not currently used.

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II99.png "image_tooltip")



    Attach the top and side panels to the Electronics box corners. Each Panel gets (4) M3 x 16mm Button head bolt and (4) M3 nuts.  You should leave the front panel off, so you can get to the USB port on your duet to do its initial configuration.

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II100.png "image_tooltip")



    Again, it’s best to leave the front panel off for now. Just install the top and rear.


    Install the power switch in the rear panel using (2) M3 x 10mm button head bolts.

    IF BUILDING THE KIT VERSION, FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS HERE: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aIc6x7Vzb-bH8-pILNBV1cXyp3JWsIa50Y6eSjMmCgM/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aIc6x7Vzb-bH8-pILNBV1cXyp3JWsIa50Y6eSjMmCgM/edit) 


#### 
    Mount the PSU & Duet


    Assuming you bought the PSU & duet wifi controllers from the BOM, the suggested mounting locations are in the picture below.  If you self-sourced you’ll need to line your PSU up and mark the holes and drill them (use a ⅛” or ¼” drill bit).  For kit users the holes are pre-drilled.  **Check your PSU voltage switch** - if you’re in the US, it should be set to 120v - it’s far easier to do it before it’s mounted.

![alt_text](images/RailCore-II102.png "image_tooltip")



        I attached my Duet Wifi with (4) M3 x 20mm button head bolts, (4) M3 washers (4) M3 nuts, and used some nylon spacers as standoffs so it was not against the side panel.


        For the PSU, use (4) M4 x 12mm Button Head Bolts, (4) M4 Fender washers (so the bolts would not pull through the holes in the PSU), and (4) M3 nuts.  


        


        Here are some sample wiring configurations

    Wiring


    This guide will not cover the intricacies of wiring the duet, but there are some recommendations.  If you bought exactly what was in the BoM and followed this guide, these will help.


    The full duet wifi wiring diagram is here.  A basic version of the wiring diagram is provided, but we recommend you use the wiki as the guide to wiring your duet.  [https://duet3d.com/wiki/Duet_WiFi_and_Ethernet_wiring_diagrams](https://duet3d.com/wiki/Duet_WiFi_and_Ethernet_wiring_diagrams)

    There are some sample prints that can be used for fan vent covers and a PSU vent cover - these can be attached to the electronics box cover using (4) M3 x 8mm Button head bolts each.


    Do a power on (smoke test) Before closing up the printer.


    The optional filament guide can be attached onto the top right extrusion using (1) M3 x 8mm button head bolt.

### Smoke Test


    First, Connect a USB cable to the duet, and connect using a serial console such as pronterface. Issue M115 and be sure you see both the duet and the duex5.  If not, stop and resolve that issue before proceeding. \
 \
Now you should be ready to power on 24v power, and the system should come up.


### Getting connected to the network


    Follow the guide here: [https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Guide/1.)+Getting+Connected+to+your+Duet/7](https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Guide/1.)+Getting+Connected+to+your+Duet/7)


### Adjusting Your belts and levelling your bed


    Once your smoke test is done and good, you’ll want to do the final belt tensioning.  These steps should be done periodically as your belts stretch, etc. So it’s a good idea to be familiar with them.


#### 	X/Y Belts


    Loosen up both of your steppers, and make sure they’re all the way in towards the printer.  The belts should already be tight enough you can’t just pop them off.  If they’re not, adjust your belt end clips until they are.  Then, pull your rear stepper by hand to put a reasonable amount on tension in the belt.  You’ll cause the Y carriage to move, that’s OK.  You don’t need this belt to to be super tight.  Tighten down the 4 button head bolts for the rear stepper.  Now, pull the front stepper while checking if the Y rail is at a 90 degree angle to the X rail.  When the two are precisely at 90 degrees to each other that’s when your belts are correctly tensioned.  This can be tricky to do with just one person.


### 


### Firmware


##### 
    The provided config files should be considered a baseline starting point if you followed the BOM.  These files are confirmed to work with with RepRapFirmware v2.01 or later. \
You can find the newest version here: [https://github.com/dc42/RepRapFirmware/releases/latest](https://github.com/dc42/RepRapFirmware/releases/latest)

	Self Source Config:

[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ngmhj4oif2dm8yg/AAC218nV-xNu42qalPdI8IHXa?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ngmhj4oif2dm8yg/AAC218nV-xNu42qalPdI8IHXa?dl=0)

    Back up the /sys file off the SD card. Then replace the config.g bed.g home*.g files with the ones from the config. The macro files can go in the macros folder on the SD card. If you're using an IR probe or piezo, delete the retractprobe.g and deployprobe.g files from the /sys folder.  If you’re using a bltouch, copy the deployprobe.g / retractprobe.g into /sys out of the bltouch folder.


    For connecting to it, follow the guide here: [https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Guide/1.)+Getting+Connected+to+your+Duet/7](https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Guide/1.)+Getting+Connected+to+your+Duet/7)


    It’s highly recommended you familiarize yourself with the duet, and update the firmware to the latest stable release.   \

### First Moves


    **This section is written to be followed in order. DO NOT SKIP STEPS. Complete each before moving on to the next.**


    For your X/Y stepper direction, follow the instructions documented here: \
[https://www.duet3d.com/wiki/Configuring_RepRapFirmware_for_a_CoreXY_printer](https://www.duet3d.com/wiki/Configuring_RepRapFirmware_for_a_CoreXY_printer)


     \
Specifically for the X stepper, starting with the hotend over the center of the bed: \
`G91 \
G1 S2 X10 F3000`


    Should move your hotend in the +X +Y directions (to the right and back of the bed)


    **If not you need to reverse the X stepper direction in config.g (M569 P0 value)**


    And for the Y stepper: \
`G91 \
G1 S2 Y10 F3000`


    Should move your hotend in the +X and -Y directions (to the right and front of the bed)


    **If not you need to reverse the Y stepper direction in config.g (M569 P1 value)**


    And for the Z steppers:


    Test (with your finger on the power button) lowering your bed by sending:


    G1 Z10 S2


    If all three of the steppers don’t move down, power off and make corrections by reversing the appropriate stepper in config.g.  You can reverse the direction of an individual stepper by editing the S0 / S1 value for it.


    Test each of your endstop switches to be sure they work. By pressing them with your finger before you try homing (Follow the RRF wiki)


    	You can see the Endstop status in the web gui, Settings, Machine properties tab


    	The X & Y endstops should read “No”, and when pressed change to “Yes”


        If this is not the case, find the M574 line in your config.g file and change the S# (if it’s 0, make it 1)


    Test your Z-Probe to be sure it is working. (Follow the RRF Wiki)


        If you are using the IR Probe, start with it shifted all the way to the top (the mount is adjustable)


        In the gui you should see the “Z Probe” value is 0.  If you place something opaque under it, the value should go to 1000.  


        Start with the IR probe all the way at the top of the mount, and run “home z”. The bed should begin slowly moving up.  Wave something under the IR probe, and the bed should stop, it should now show you’re at Z0.  (If it doesn’t stop, immediately hit the power switch)


    If both of your endstops and Z probe are working, hit the home buttons (one at a time… and keep a hand near the power switch in case something doesn’t work) to home the printer. **USE THE BUTTONS, NOT G28.  Hit home X, then home Y, then home Z, then home all.**


    To level the bed, hit the “Auto Bed Compensation” button in the web interface, or send “G32” which will run bed.g  Your printer should probe near each of the 3 leadscrews, and then you should see output similar to this in the gcode console:


    Leadscrew adjustments made: 0.143 -0.071 0.027, points used 3, deviation before 0.082 after 0.000


    Once your bed is level, do a “paper test”.  Run “Home Z”.  Once the printer is homed, place a sheet of paper under the nozzle.  Jog down until the nozzle grips the paper.  If you can’t jog down far enough, you can run “M208 S1 Z-3” from the gcode console.  Note, this will let you jog an extra 3mm down, be careful not to jog too far and break something.  Once the nozzle is touching the paper, pull the paper out of the way, and run the “probe point” macro.  It will do a Z probe again.  If it stops between 1.9 and 2.1mm you’re good.  If not, adjust the IR Probe height, and repeat the paper test. (you should not need to adjust the height of your BLTouch if you installed it with the brass spacers, but you do need to adjust the Z value for the G31 line in the BLTouch section of your config.g as follows) Once it stops in that range, open config.g and edit the Z value in the “G31” line near the bottom with the Z height at which it stops.


    For the following steps, you should home all 3 axis first.  Make all of the moves slowly so you don’t damage anything!


    The max x/y/z are in the config.g provided are fairly conservative.  To properly set them, temporarily raise them with this command:


    M208 X375 Y375 Z400


    Start with Y.  Manually move to X150, Y250 by jogging it using the controls in the Web UI.  Slowly increase Y, stopping before your Y axis makes contact with the X carriage.  Change the Y value in the M208 command in your config.g to match.


    Repeat this with X, moving to Y150, X250, and stopping before your Y carriage makes contact with the bearing block.  Note your Max X value and adjust it in the M208 command in config.g.


    For Z, simply lower the bed to 220, then step it down slowly.  Watch that the screws on the bottom of the Z yoke don’t bottom out.  Stop before they make contact.  Note your Z height, and set this in config.g for your max Z.


#### 
    If your Z axis Binds


    If you get binding in Z, you may need to make some adjustments.  Repeat the same process as when you installed the Z axis originally, running Z down to the bottom with the upper &  lower brackets loose (loosen the bolts holding the Z brackets to the frame, then run the bed all the way down).  Tighten the lower Z brackets back down while the bed is near the bottom, then square the extrusions to the frame, and tighten the top Z brackets.  It’s critical the extrusions are squared to the rest of the frame.	


#### 
     \
 \
Final Tuning

	Tune your hotend PID using: \


	M303 H1 S240 \
 \
	From the gcode console.  Save the values into config.g, details here: \
	[https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Gcode#Section_M303_Run_heater_tuning](https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Gcode#Section_M303_Run_heater_tuning)

 \
	Tune your bed PID the same way using:


    M303 H0 S60 \
 \
For saving the values into config.g one trick is to run M500 - this writes them into config-override.g  - you can copy the lines for H0 and H1 out of there and paste them in place of the defaults in your config.g.  Alternatively, you can run M500, and then add an M501 at the very end of your config.g which will load config-override.g and use those values (you just have to remember that everything in config-override.g will be run in addition to  your config.g)

 \
	Calibrate your steps/mm of your extruder. \
